In this project, I analyzed sales data to identify trends, optimize strategies, and provide actionable insights. The objective was to help the business understand customer behavior, improve product performance, and forecast future sales effectively.
Components and Workflow
Data Collection and Cleaning

"The data was sourced from . It included key variables such as product names, sales revenue, customer demographics, purchase dates, regions, and quantities sold.
I performed data cleaning steps like handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats to ensure accuracy."
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

"I visualized the data using tools like Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) or Tableau to identify trends and patterns.
For example, I examined sales performance across regions, product categories, and time periods to pinpoint top-performing segments.
I also analyzed customer purchasing behavior, identifying the most frequent buyers and their preferences."
Key Metrics and Insights

"I calculated metrics such as:
Total Sales Revenue: Overall performance.
Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth: Growth trends over time.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Revenue generated by individual customers over their lifetime.
Profit Margin by Product: Identified high-margin items and areas to improve.
These insights helped prioritize focus areas for the business."
Forecasting and Predictions

"Using machine learning techniques like Linear Regression, ARIMA, or Prophet, I developed models to forecast future sales based on historical data.
For example, I predicted seasonal demand spikes, enabling better inventory management and resource allocation."
Dashboards and Reporting

"I created an interactive dashboard using Power BI/Tableau to present findings to stakeholders, enabling them to view sales data in real time and make informed decisions.
